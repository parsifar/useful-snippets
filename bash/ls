ls command lists the contents of directories or information about the files.

to list the contents of a directory
> ls /path/to/dir/

to list info about a file
> ls -l /path/to/file

-l includes info about the permissions, owner, size ....

-a lists all the contents including the hidden files

for a directory, if I wanna see the info about the directory itself (rather than its contents) I use -d flag
> ls -dl /path/to/dir/

by default the size shown in the output is in bytes, for example for a text file with 800 characters it's 800 bytes. needless to say this can be hard to read for larger files. to make the size human readable I can use the -h flag
> ls -lh /file/or/dir/

-R lists the contents of a directory recursively
ls -R /path/to/dir/

Sorting:
by default ls sorts the output alphabetically based on the filenames.

-S sorts the output based on filesize (largest first)

-t soerts based on time (newest first)

-r reverses the order of sorting
